Today many companies, including startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), use cloud technology for computing and storage. This technology facilitates having adequate and flexible hardware and software infrastructure to support business processes. However, many companies, mostly SMEs, have not considered the implementation of security protocols to guarantee confidentiality, integrity and privacy of the information or they are not sure of migrating to the cloud because there is a growing concern regarding compliance with privacy or confidentiality requirements for sensitive data.

Different works have identified and addressed the problems of confidentiality, integrity and privacy of the data stored and processed in the cloud, creating varied proposals. However, the available jobs focus on some aspects while neglecting others, while the services available in the cloud charge for security services that should be essential. It is important to find an appropriate balance between confidentiality, integrity, cost, and performance.

This work proposes the design and implementation of a model that allows to store files in the cloud and share them among authorized users, guaranteeing their confidentiality, integrity and privacy, minimizing response time and supporting the associated policy administration process, in order to facilitate the use of the model in real environments. The model integrates a label-based data classification method, this allows users to easily define the confidentiality and integrity requirements associated with the data they want to store in the cloud. Based on the labels, the model defines a set of security policies for data protection, combining encryption, fragmentation and data distribution.

Based on the model, a prototype was implemented that allows users to classify the information and implement the defined policies, thus guaranteeing the confidentiality and integrity of the stored information. In addition, it allows files to be shared with users authorized by the owner. The prototype offers users the possibility of managing security for their information, transparently and at no additional cost since everything is managed by the system thus it does not require a contract of security services with a cloud provider.ï€
